# Features_And_Functionalities
- This is an e-commerce website with a homepage featuring various brand categories. Each category contains a selection of products related to that brand. When a user clicks on a brand card, they will be directed to a page displaying the products associated with that particular brand category.
- On the product page, each product is accompanied by details and an update option. When a user clicks on the 'Details' option, they can view the product's details and make a decision to add the product to their cart. On the other hand, when an admin clicks on the 'Update' option, they can modify or update various product attributes such as the product name, image, type, price, description, and more.
- Please note that users can only view product details if they are registered and logged in to the website. The same applies to administrators; they must be registered and logged in to update product information. This website incorporates a user authentication system to ensure that only registered users and authorized administrators have access to these features.
- When accessing the product details page, a login page will be displayed. To proceed, users must provide their correct email and password to log in. Once authenticated, users gain access to the product details and can add the product to their cart list..
- In the header section, there is a 'My Cart' page, where all the items in the user's cart are aggregated. This feature is integrated with the user authentication system. When a user is logged in, they can access their personal cart, review the items, and take actions such as making a purchase or performing other relevant actions.
- In the header section, there is an 'Add Product' page. On this page, users can input product information, and by doing so, they can add a new product to the products page, categorizing it based on the relevant brand. This feature enables users to contribute to the product catalog of the website.
